Welcome to my repository!

My name is Kryštof Tomsa and I am currently studying data analytics at Prague University of Economics and Business (VŠE). This repository contains small projects that I did at school or in my free time. Feel free to have a look at the projects and use them any way you want. Also, if you have some suggestions, you are welcome share them.
